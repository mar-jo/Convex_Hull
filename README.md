Project Instructions & Need to Knows:
- Project will mostly run without setups beside the usage of the external library "SDL2".
- Follow these instructions to get the code running locally on your machine using SDL2: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvc2019/index.php
- You can read in basic .txt Files: When prompted to enter a file name, make sure not to forget to write ".txt" at the end.
- For randomly generated data, you can change the size of points within "Field.h" with "NUMBER_OF_POINTS".
- The code may take a while to either read OR generate data, it works fine on my machine with 32GB RAM. There have been instances where 16GB may not be enough or take excessively long, please keep that in mind.
- For the Generation of 100Mio. Datapoints, you may have to wait up to 4 Minutes.
- Have fun!
